Structural analysis is considered the most essential core course for civil and structural engineering. It provides the fundamental understanding of the distribution and transmission of loads in any structural form. Statically determinate structures, such as beams, frames and trusses are thoroughly studied.
The student should be able to evaluate all the internal forces and straining actions in these structural forms under various kinds of loads and different loading cases.
