The aim of the course is to develop a deeper understanding of structural steelwork design based on limit state principles. The material covered in the course enable students to familiarize with the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). The course begins with the design of cold-formed sections and steel-concrete composite beams. This is followed by the design of plate girders. A general description is given of the plate girder behaviour in terms of elastic buckling of web in shear and bending, and web in tension field action. Students are introduced to detailed design of stiffeners, splices and moment connections. Students are also introduced to fatigue behaviour of steel structures: factors affecting fatigue behaviour, recommended details, stress range, load cycles. Finally, a summary to the design of tubular structures and their connections is demonstrated.
