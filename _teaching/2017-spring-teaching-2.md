Drawing is the language of engineers and technicians working in the different phases of a project. The course Civil Engineering Drawing differs from Engineering Drawing and is tailored for areas and tasks specific in civil engineering projects. Especially in this discipline, drawings have a legally binding character and must be clear, non-unanimous and follow certain conventions and standards. This counts the more as we are normally dealing with projects of a one-time-, unique character. First, the meaning and importance of drawings shall be demonstrated to the students; followed by explanations on drawing conventions and standards as well as systems to identify and administer the large number of drawings in a civil engineering project. This will be followed by principles of drawing techniques to learn how to prepare a drawing by hand. In the last third of the course, the use of drawing software (AutoCAD) will be introduced. The course will cover a theoretical part at the very beginning, followed by lectures demonstrating the use of drawings in the various disciplines of civil engineering, i.e. reinforced concrete structures, steel structures, hydro structures and traffic structures and surveying. By the end of the course there will be an introduction to drawing software (AutoCAD) through tutorials.
