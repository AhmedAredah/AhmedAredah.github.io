The main purpose of this introductory course is to provide “Civil Engineering” students with ample information as regards conventional materials used in the civil/construction domain. Materials such as concrete, steel, masonry, asphalt, wood and composites differ in their properties (e.g. molecular structure, mechanical behaviour and physical properties); all addressed within the course content. For each of the former materials this course provides the necessary understanding of their nature, constituents, manufacturing process and applications. Mechanical and physical-property tests are conducted (in laboratory and in-situ); data is obtained and analysed; information content is drawn as regards material properties and classification. This introductory course yields the fundamentals for other design courses such as “Reinforced Concrete Design” and “Steel Structures Design”. It is also a mandatory prerequisite for other materials’ related courses that deal with “Concrete Technology”, “Repair and Strengthening of Concrete Structures” and “Innovative Construction Materials”.
