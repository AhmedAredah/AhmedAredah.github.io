The course addresses as a core course all civil engineering students of the 6th semester and presents an introduction to the wide field of construction management within the process of realising a project, its requirements, tasks and relationship to other disciplines in the environs of a project. It also gives an introduction to the development of a project per se, including its life cycle and to specific organizational aspects. An introduction to equipment technology will be given as a base knowledge to understand how construction machinery if today is working. This is followed by the different construction methods for earth and road works, foundation and structure. Finishing trades are presented with their components and implementation issues for finishing trades.
