ShipNetSim is an open-source simulation software designed to analyze ship energy consumption and emissions in extensive maritime networks. Built with a modular and adaptable structure using Qt6, it integrates propulsion-resistance models, real-time environmental data, and advanced path-finding algorithms for longitudinal vessel motion analysis.
