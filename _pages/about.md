Welcome to the official website of **Ahmed S. Aredah**, a multi-disciplinary engineer, researcher, and software developer transforming the future of freight transportation, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability.

### About Me
I am currently pursuing a **Ph.D. in Civil Engineering** and a **Master’s in Computer Science** at **Virginia Tech**, where I lead advanced research initiatives in freight logistics, energy efficiency, and transportation modeling. With a rich professional background spanning academia, government-funded research, and industry, my mission is to build intelligent systems that drive national infrastructure resilience and sustainable development.

### What I Do
My work lies at the intersection of **transportation systems**, **computer science**, and **sustainability**. I develop simulation-based solutions, AI-driven analytics, and digital infrastructure tools to address energy consumption, emissions, and logistics inefficiencies across the U.S. freight sector.

### Research & Development Highlights
- **ShipNetSim** and **NeTrainSim**: Open-source simulators I developed for evaluating energy consumption and emissions across maritime and rail freight networks.
- **Multi-Decadal Decarbonization Pathways (DOE, ARPA-E)**: Contributed to a $1.5M federally funded project to simulate energy use for diesel, bio-diesel, and hydrogen-powered trains.
- **Door-to-Door Freight Optimization** (USDOT UTC): Developed agent-based modeling frameworks for improving U.S. freight logistics using simulation and predictive analytics.
- **Port Optimization at Norfolk International Terminal** (Moffatt & Nichol): Boosted throughput by 375% through dynamic modeling and the development of custom simulation tools.

### PhD Research: Building an Integrated Freight Simulation Ecosystem

During my PhD at **Virginia Tech**, I developed a suite of simulation tools aimed at optimizing freight logistics, energy consumption, and multimodal network performance across the United States. The diagram below illustrates the simulation ecosystem I built—each module shown was developed by me, with the exception of the **Integration** component.

The key tools include:

- **CargoNetSim**: Orchestrates end-to-end freight movement across rail, ship, and terminal systems.
- **NeTrainSim**: Simulates network-level freight train motion and energy consumption across the U.S. rail network.
- **ShipNetSim**: Models ship dynamics, fuel usage, and emissions across global shipping routes.
- **TerminalSim**: Captures port operations to evaluate throughput and optimize loading/unloading.
- **NeTrainLine**: Evaluates path optimization and routing through a dynamically coded network.

These tools empower stakeholders, from policymakers to industry leaders, to make data-informed decisions aligned with **national decarbonization strategies** and **infrastructure modernization goals**.


### Industry Impact
- Spearheaded **web-based infrastructure management systems** using Azure, React.js, and FlexTerm.
- Led training and technical presentations for stakeholders on infrastructure simulation, data analytics, and system integration.
- Designed highway and port infrastructure for multi-million-dollar national projects using BIM, Civil 3D, and scheduling software.

### Publications
I have authored several **peer-reviewed articles** in journals such as *Applied Energy*, *Railway Engineering Science*, and *Energies*. My work has been presented at international conferences including the **Transportation Research Board (TRB)** and **IEEE Smart Mobility Conference**.

**Selected publications**:
- *Energy Optimization in Freight Train Operations*, **Applied Energy**, 2024  
- *Comparative Analysis of Alternative Powertrains*, **Applied Energy**, 2024  
- *NeTrainSim Simulator Development*, **Railway Engineering Science**, 2024
