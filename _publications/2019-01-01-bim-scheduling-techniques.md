This paper explores the integration of four-dimensional (4D) BIM with project scheduling techniques to manage construction risks effectively. Through a survey study, it evaluates the adoption of BIM and the Critical Path Method (CPM) within the construction industry, demonstrating 4D BIMâ€™s advantages in project coordination and scheduling.

**Abstract:**  
Risks are present in every construction project and can be of technical, commercial, or other nature. Often, risks lead to late project delivery, commercial losses, or even project failure. Nonetheless, diligent and efficient project planning and scheduling can assist to decrease such risks and their effects on project delivery, i.e., managing these risks. Further, building information modeling (BIM) can be a capable process of keeping stakeholders updated with the latest information, thus enhancing project communication and information flow. Combining the capabilities of BIM and the right scheduling technique would improve the deliverability and constructability of projects. A questionnaire has been distributed to measure the effects of four-dimensional (4-D) BIM on the construction industry. The survey analysis stated that 51% of the candidates use the Critical Path Method technique over the others, and BIM is positively affecting the project coordination, clash detection, and design validation. It, also, concludes the high efficiency and benefits obtained from utilizing 4-D BIM. Ultimately, the results, also, stated clearly that the project planning and scheduling including sequence assessment is much easier in the 4-D BIM environment than the traditional 2-D planning.
