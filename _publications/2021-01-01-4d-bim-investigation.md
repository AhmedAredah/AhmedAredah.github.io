This paper investigates the integration of 4D BIM with scheduling techniques, specifically CPM and LBMS, to address ineffective construction planning. The study utilizes case studies to demonstrate the advantages of 4D BIM in reducing planning conflicts and optimizing project schedules.

**Abstract:**  
Ineffective construction planning contributes to unsuccessful project delivery. Fortunately, many scheduling techniques address such an issue. On the other hand, BIM is introduced to facilitate project coordination. Combining the capabilities of scheduling methods and BIM will result in project duration and cost reduction. The purpose of this research is to evaluate 4D BIM and compare between most used scheduling techniques; CPM and LBMS using case studies. 4D BIM proved superiority in planning conflicts reduction. Further, case study comparison show LBMS is superior in quantifying project materials and in visualizing and selecting the optimum what-if analysis of different project schedules.
