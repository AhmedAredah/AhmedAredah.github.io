This paper investigates the energy efficiency and environmental implications of six powertrain technologies for freight trains in the U.S. rail network. The analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of energy consumption and emissions reduction potential across varying scenarios and geographies, highlighting sustainable alternatives for rail transport.

**Abstract:**  
This study assesses the energy efficiency and environmental implications of six powertrain technologies in the U.S. freight rail network: diesel, biodiesel, diesel-hybrid, biodiesel-hybrid, hydrogen fuel cell, and electric. Utilizing a simulation model, energy consumption at the tank across different demand scenarios and geographical regions is conducted. The study revealed electric powertrains as the standout, slashing energy consumption at the tank by 56% compared to traditional diesel, with the potential for zero CO₂ emissions when powered by green energy sources. Biodiesel and biodiesel-hybrid also outperformed conventional diesel, cutting CO₂ tank emissions by 6% and 21%, respectively. Diesel-hybrid registered a 16% reduction in both tank energy and diesel consumption, while hydrogen fuel cells demonstrated a 15% energy consumption drop at the tank and zero emissions. Implementing these advanced technologies requires considerable infrastructure investment and adaptation, which is beyond the scope of our analysis. While centered on the U.S. rail network, our findings offer valuable insights for global freight rail systems, underpinning the push for sustainable powertrain transitions.
