This paper addresses the critical need for decarbonization in maritime shipping by introducing ShipNetSim, an open-source multi-ship simulator that combines advanced hydrodynamic modeling, dynamic ship-following techniques, real-time environmental data, and cybersecurity threat simulation to quantify and evaluate marine fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

**Abstract:**  
The imperative of decarbonization in maritime shipping is underscored by the sector's sizeable contribution to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. ShipNetSim, an open-source multi-ship simulator created in this study, combines state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modeling, dynamic ship-following techniques, real-time environmental data, and cybersecurity threat simulation to quantify and evaluate marine fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. ShipNetSim uses well-validated approaches, such as the Holtrop resistance and B-Series propeller analysis with a ship-following model inspired by traffic flow theory, augmented with a novel module simulating cyber threats (e.g., GPS spoofing) to evaluate operational efficiency and resilience. In a case study simulation of the journey of an S175 container vessel from Savannah to Algeciras, the simulator estimated the total fuel consumption to be 478 tons of heavy fuel oil and approximately 1495 tons of CO2 emissions for a trip of 7 days and 15 h within 13.1% of reported operational estimates. A twelve-month sensitivity analysis revealed a marginal 1.5% range of fuel consumption variation, demonstrating limiting variability for different environmental conditions. ShipNetSim not only yields realistic predictions of energy consumption and emissions but is also demonstrated to be a credible framework for the evaluation of operational scenarios—including speed adjustment, optimized routing, and alternative fuel strategies—that directly contribute to reducing the marine carbon footprint. This capability supports industry stakeholders and policymakers in achieving compliance with global decarbonization targets, such as those established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
