This paper presents a diesel train energy consumption model that leverages easily accessible operational input variables, such as speed, acceleration, and roadway grade, to estimate instantaneous energy consumption. The model is designed for real-time applications and validated with extensive real-world data.

**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces a simple diesel train energy consumption model that calculates the instantaneous energy consumption using vehicle operational input variables, including the instantaneous speed, acceleration, and roadway grade, which can be easily obtained from global positioning system (GPS) loggers. The model was tested against real-world data and produced an error of −1.33% for all data and errors ranging from −12.4% to +8.0% for energy consumption of four train datasets amounting to a total of 5854 km trips. The study also validated the proposed model with separate data that were collected between Valencia and Cuenca, Spain, which had a total length of 198 km and found that the model was accurate, yielding a relative error of −1.55% for the total energy consumption. These results show that the proposed model can be used by train operators, transportation planners, policy makers, and environmental engineers to evaluate the energy consumption effects of train operational projects and train simulation within intermodal transportation planning tools.
